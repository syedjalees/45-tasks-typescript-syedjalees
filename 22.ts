// Task 22 = Intentional Error: If you havenâ€™t received an array index error in one of your programs yet, try to make
// one happen. Change an index in one of your programs to produce an index error. Make sure you correct the error 
// before closing the program.


let index_error:string[]=["jalees","uzair","rizwan"] // simple array list 

console.log("index error:  "+index_error[3]);// index 3 is not in our array list so it must be get undefined


// index 3 is out of range so i am correcting the index number 
console.log("corrected  "+index_error[2]);
