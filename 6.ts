// Task 6 = Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and 
// end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, 
// so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping the white spaces.

console.log( Before);

let After:string = (Before.trim())
